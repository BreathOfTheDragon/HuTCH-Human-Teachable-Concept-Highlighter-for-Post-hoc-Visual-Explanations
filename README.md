# HuTCH-Human-Teachable-Concept-Highlighter-for-Post-hoc-Visual-Explanations

Please create a conda environment based on the provided requirements.txt or the HuTCH.yml file.


This project is structured in two phases.


The first phase consists of using the iNaturalist website to query the bee and wasp species of Colorado, downloading the related observations from iNaturalist, and training a CNN model (ResNet-152) from the downloaded images.


The second phase of the project is using the HuTCH framework to come up with the human teachable explanations to be compared to expert explanations and to be used in educational settings.
